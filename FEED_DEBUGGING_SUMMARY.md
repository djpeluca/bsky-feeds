# Feed Debugging and Performance Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. 20+ Minute Feed Delays
The primary issue was caused by several factors:

- **Rate Limiting Configuration**: The rate limiter had `undefined` values, causing unpredictable behavior
- **Insufficient Connection Monitoring**: No visibility into Jetstream connection health
- **Inefficient List Updates**: Author lists were only updated every 15 minutes
- **Extremely Short Cache**: The moize cache was only 30 milliseconds, causing excessive re-computation

### 2. Lost Instant Refresh Functionality
- **Inadequate Cache Configuration**: 30ms moize cache was too short, causing constant re-execution
- **Long List Update Intervals**: 15-minute intervals meant new authors weren't picked up quickly
- **No Real-time Diagnostics**: Limited visibility into feed processing pipeline

## Changes Made

### Rate Limiting Improvements (`src/addn/rateLimit.ts`)
```typescript
// BEFORE: undefined configuration causing issues
const _limit = pRateLimit({
  interval: undefined,
  rate: undefined,
  concurrency: undefined,
  maxDelay: undefined,
})

// AFTER: Proper configuration with monitoring
const _limit = pRateLimit({
  interval: 1000,    // 1 second
  rate: 10,          // 10 requests per second  
  concurrency: 5,    // Max 5 concurrent requests
  maxDelay: 30000,   // Max 30 second delay
})
```

### Cache Optimization (`src/addn/algoManager.ts`)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Long cache times preventing instant refresh
public static cacheAge(params): Number {
  if (params.cursor) return 600  // 10 minutes
  return 30                      // 30 seconds
}

// AFTER: Minimal cache for instant refresh
public static cacheAge(params): Number {
  if (params.cursor) return 300  // 5 minutes for pagination
  return 5                       // 5 seconds for fresh feeds
}
```

### Feed Generation Cache Fix (`src/methods/feed-generation.ts`)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Extremely short cache causing excessive computation
const algoHandlerMoized = moize(algo, {
  isPromise: true,
  maxAge: 30,  // 30 MILLISECONDS - way too short!
  isShallowEqual: true,
})

// AFTER: Reasonable cache duration
const algoHandlerMoized = moize(algo, {
  isPromise: true,
  maxAge: 5000,  // 5 seconds in milliseconds - balanced approach
  isShallowEqual: true,
})
```

### List Update Frequency (`src/algos/BaseFeedManager.ts`)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Updates every 15 minutes
protected readonly LIST_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 1000 * 60 * 15

// AFTER: Updates every 5 minutes
protected readonly LIST_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 1000 * 60 * 5
```

### Connection Health Monitoring (`src/subscription.ts`)
Added comprehensive monitoring system:
- **Health checks every 2 minutes**
- **Warning after 5 minutes without posts**
- **Critical alert after 20 minutes without posts**
- **Connection event logging (open, close, error)**
- **Performance metrics tracking**

### Structured Logging
Replaced scattered `console.log` statements with structured logging:
- **Prefixed log messages** with component names `[ComponentName]`
- **Added timing information** for operations
- **Included diagnostic data** (duration, counts, status)
- **Consistent error formatting** across all components

## Key Performance Improvements

### 1. Instant Refresh Restoration
- **Fixed moize cache**: From 30ms to 5 seconds for proper caching balance
- **Reduced cache ages**: From 30s to 5s for fresh feed requests
- **Faster list updates**: 15min â†’ 5min intervals

### 2. 20+ Minute Delay Detection
- **Connection health monitoring** detects stalled streams
- **Rate limiting fixes** prevent request timeouts  
- **Comprehensive error logging** shows exact failure points

### 3. Better Diagnostics
- **Request timing tracking** identifies slow operations
- **Post processing metrics** show throughput
- **List update monitoring** tracks author/blocklist changes

## Environment Variable Impact

The `FEEDGEN_TASK_INTEVAL_MINS` change from 20 to 1 minute was correctly implemented but additional optimizations were needed in:
- **Cache durations** (moize was misconfigured)
- **List update frequencies**  
- **Connection monitoring**
- **Rate limiting configuration**

## Critical Discovery: Moize Cache Misconfiguration

The biggest issue was that `maxAge: 30` in moize meant **30 milliseconds**, not 30 seconds. This caused:
- **Constant re-computation** of feed algorithms
- **Excessive CPU usage**
- **Poor performance** under load
- **No effective caching** of algorithm results

The fix to 5000ms (5 seconds) provides a reasonable balance between freshness and performance.

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Log Patterns to Watch
1. **Connection Issues**:
   ```
   [StreamSubscription] WARNING: No posts received for X minutes
   [StreamSubscription] CRITICAL: No posts received for 20+ minutes
   ```

2. **Performance Issues**:
   ```
   [RateLimit] Slow request completed in Xms
   [FeedGeneration] Slow feed request for X: Xms
   [BatchUpdate] Error fetching posts chunk after Xms
   ```

3. **List Update Problems**:
   ```
   [BaseFeedManager] Slow list fetch for X: Xms
   [BaseFeedManager] List update failed after Xms
   ```

### Health Check Metrics
- **Posts processed per minute**
- **Average request duration**
- **Connection uptime**
- **List update success rate**
- **Cache hit/miss ratios**

## Testing the Changes

1. **Monitor logs** for the new structured messages
2. **Check feed refresh times** - should be near-instant for new posts
3. **Verify connection health** - no gaps longer than 5 minutes
4. **Test list updates** - new authors appear within 5 minutes
5. **Performance metrics** - requests complete under 2 seconds

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, these files can be quickly reverted:
- `src/addn/rateLimit.ts` - Restore original undefined config temporarily
- `src/addn/algoManager.ts` - Increase cache times back to 30/600 seconds
- `src/methods/feed-generation.ts` - Revert moize cache back to 30ms (though not recommended)
- `src/subscription.ts` - Remove health monitoring if it causes issues

The changes are backwards compatible and can be selectively reverted without breaking functionality.
